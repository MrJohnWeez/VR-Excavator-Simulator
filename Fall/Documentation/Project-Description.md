## Purpose

- Create an excavator simulator that educates users while maintaining a fun game-like environment
- Allow people who do not have access to excavation equipment to learn/emulate how to operate heavy machinery
- Provide educational entertainment via virtual reality
- Fill a gap in the market since there are no other Steam VR excavator simulators that attempt to mimic reality

## Goals

- Learn the entire process of designing, implementing, testing, and publishing a Steam game.
- Create a fun-to-play simulator/game for VR users.
- Allow users to mess around with excavators and the excavation of dirt in real-time.
- Learn how to manage a larger project
