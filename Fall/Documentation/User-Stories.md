# User Stories

1. As a VR user, I want to play a game sitting down so that I can take a break from most of the standing VR games available.

2. As an excavation expert, I want to be able to switch control configurations (ISO and SAE), so that I can learn how to operate different machine models.

3. As a person who has played simulator games before, I want to be able to move around a open world map with optional tutorials/levels, so that I have the choice on how I play in the order I choose.

4. As a person who is new to VR and knows nothing about excavators, I want to follow a short tutorial on the controls and operations, so that I am not confused and just get frustrated.

5. As someone who only owns a VR system, I want to be able to play the simulator with all itâ€™s features, so that I do not miss out on features of the game for not having the correct hardware.
