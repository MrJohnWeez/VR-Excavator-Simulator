# Major Constraints

## Economic Cost

This project will have a budget of around $200. This is due to needed realtime terrain modification which is a Unity asset for $90 and the cost of putting an application on Steam ($100 publication fee). The goal is to sell the game on Steam in an attempt to recover some of this cost and/or find a sponsor who would donate money to the project. This sponsor's logo/name would be presented within the application as a thank you.

All other models, sounds, textures, code libraries will be open sourced or commercial licence assets. The hardware used to develop this software was already pre-purchased for a different personal use. This hardware includes an Oculus Rift, Controllers, Monitors, and VR-ready PC. All development can be done via John's home (Since he is the only member for this project).

## Time

Time will be a constraint because the project is due April of 2021. This only leaves a few months for prototyping, development, testing, and bug fixing. The project will also have to be completed while taking other college classes. These classes will eat up development time and since John may be working part-time during the Fall and Spring semester, less time can be dedicated to the project each week. The hope is to contribute at-least 8-10 hours of work per week during the spring semester.

## Scope

Since this is a team of 1, determining the scope of the project was up to one person and what they think can be done in the time given. The scope of the project was kept relatively large because I believe it is easier to trim off features that may take longer than expected once project development has begun. An example of trimming could be that two levels are planned but there is only time to develop one of them.

Non-critical features such as low level saving (per mission/stage object saving) could be cut at the last minute in order to stay on project deliverables. General saving of level progress could still work but saving the exact state of each level is not as critical or game breaking.

## Professional/Technical

The technical expertise needed for the project is listed below:

* Hydraulics physics
* Realtime dynamic mesh deformation
* Advanced 3d particle systems within Unity

To help mitigate the gap between my knowledge and the technical expertise gap I have I will preform research based on these topics. I have found hydraulic diagrams and some examples of how others emulate these joints within a game engine. I will be using a Unity asset that allows realtime terrain modifications. The asset also comes with an active discord community for support. As for the particle system more testing and research is required but since particles are "just a nice to have" instead of "mission critical" for the VR simulator, it will be saved until closer to project deadlines.

## Ethical and Legal

Any assets, code, plugins used within this project will be compliant with copyright and trademark laws. All licenses will be for commercial use since the app is likely to go onto the Steam store for sale. The user of the application is fully responsible for their actions while in game and the selling company is not responsible for any hardware related issues.

No user identifiable data will be collected through Steam.

The price of the Steam app will be set for financial benefits from the development of the app. Money generated through steam over the development cost of the app will go directly back into the app until the app is fully functional.

The VR simulator does not substitute for professional licensed training but instead is only to be used as an emulation of what it is like to operate such machinery. The developer is not responsible for any real world accidents, issues, safety practices, and cannot be held responsible for any non-video game actions of users.

## Security

No user identifiable data will be collected through Steam. The app is a locally ran game with no networking abilities other than though the Steam APIs. All data is stored locally where the game is saved to. There are no privacy or virus concerns with this application.

## Social

The public will be allowed to download the app once they pay the sale price on Steam. Anyone who plays this VR simulator will need access to an Oculus headset, strong PC, and basic knowledge of how to setup and use VR systems. The simulator will teach you the basics of operating an excavator while in VR.

## Environmental

The game will only be available on Steam for the scope of this project. This may be a downside to people who do not have access to Steam or the required hardware to run a VR program.

This application will not negatively impact the environment directly but technically would be encouraging the use of hardware that uses energy for entertainment.

## Diversity and Cultural

This simulator will give people the ability to see the culture of excavator operation and what it feels like to operate heavy machinery. This simulator does not replace the true culture and feel of operating a true heavy machine but will simulate those feelings. Diversity does not play a role in this application. The application will only be offered in the English language.
