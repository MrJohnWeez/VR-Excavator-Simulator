# Tasks List

Since this is a **solo team, John Wiesner** will be working on all of the tasks.

1. Research on what is the best real-time dirt simulation technology to use within Unity.
2. Research how to build a Steam app.
3. Design Missions (Tutorial and Pond) and their stages in great detail (on paper).
4. Design free roam terrain and what objects will be present in the map (on paper). 
5. Create a list of what asset types will be needed for the project (Models, Textures, Icons).
6. Determine what free or paid model assets will be used.
7. Design basic user interface layout and figure out what icons will be used.
8. Create template data structure used to store player save data and settings.
9. Set up SteamVR in Unity 2020 and get Oculus controls working.
10. Program excavator-like controls and control an excavator model.
11. Program basic implementation of digging/placing dirt with excavator.
12. Program grabbing objects with excavator thumb.
13. Program the falling of trees.
14. Add steam API: Steamworks.NET and create a build for steam.
15. Set up basic testing area and get at least two non-team members to test simulator and to document their feedback (ideally on different hardware too).
16. Tweak current systems to accommodate testerâ€™s feedback.
17. Swap out free assets for paid assets (only if necessary).
18. Create basic non-stylized world-space UI for menu navigation (Main menu, Settings, Missions)
19. Create tutorial mission stages (Basic controls, Excavating tutorial, pick/place objects tutorial).
20. Create pond mission stages (Remove trees, remove large boulders, dig pond, dig covert pipe, cover pipe with dirt, place in riprap).
21. Implement save and load of high-level data (Settings, Missions completed).
22. Implement world-space user interface menus (Main menu, Settings, Missions).
23. Implement save and load of low-level data (Mission progress, dirt moved, objects moved).
24. Add three save slots on main menu.
25. Create test cases for simulator.
26. Test simulator and fix bugs that appear.
27. Have one newer person test simulator and one or more other people test the simulator (Possibly on different hardware).
28. Preform final tweaks, bug fixes, changes and then test a few more times.
29. Publicly release app on steam.

*It was hard to keep this list short and a much more in-depth list will be made in the future.*
