# Milestones

See timeline below

1. **Identify project scope**

    Determine what the simulator will have in it. Determine what missions/levels can a person play and what each stage of the mission is.

2. **Determine what assets will be used**

    Determine how much each asset will be and where it is coming from. See list below ordered in importance:

    * Technology assets (digging terrain, Steam publishing)
    * Models (excavator, rocks, buildings, etc)
    * Textures
    * Sounds
    * Music
  
3. **Create working prototype**

    Create a prototype app that works well enough to get the basics working. This is meant to be a quick and dirty implementation to get the technologies working together.

    Complete this list of tasks in order:

    * Create Steamworks account and page
    * Create Unity project with SteamVR and SteamWorks API
    * Get VR headset working in Unity
    * Set up flat freeroam area with controllable excavator
    * Add basic excavator functionality (Digging, Grabbing, Moving)
    * Add basic menu navigation

4. **Test first prototype**

    Make sure the first proof of concept design mimics a real life excavator and that it "feels playable".

5. **Clean up and organize project**

    Take the findings in the prototype stage and implement them in organized and clean way. The code and project should be maintainable and organized.

6. **Implement Missions and Freeroam**

    * Set up a missions and stages framework for project
    * Implement the tutorial mission and its stages
    * Implement the pond mission and its stages
    * Add a few objects to freeroam mode (cars, tires, bricks, etc) that player can grab and move

7. **Add saving/loading of game data**

    This allows a user to save the progress of a mission or stage so they can continue at a later date. Terrain and objects should be saved within missions but the freeroam mode will not have and saving states.

8. **Test final version and make fixes**

    Stress test the simulator on different hardware using different people. Note down any bugs or flaws found during this stage. Fix any major outstanding bugs or issues.

9. **Deploy app to Steam**

    Release VR excavator simulator game on steam as a alpha/beta app. The app will most likely be free while in the beta stages.
