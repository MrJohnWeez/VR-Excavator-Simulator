# Self-Assessment Essay

## Individual Contribution

Since I worked on my senior design project by myself I was responsible for every task. These tasks ranged from 3d modeling, project planning, and programming to user testing, Steam publishing, and promotion material designer. This semester I applied and built upon my skills as a developer and as a game designer. Last fall semester, I identified what I hoped to learn from this project:

*“Producing this type of application will also broaden my knowledge of game publication, production, and prototyping. This allows me to fully understand the whole process instead of just the programming aspect”. ~John Wiesner last fall*

The prototyping stage for this project took a whole lot longer than I initially expected. It was about double the effort when viewing the number of hours the project took. I was able to learn better ways to estimate hours and how to focus effort where it counted the most. Even though I would have given up on the project multiple times over if it were not for a school assignment, I would not change a single process. I learned so much throughout the process, even the frustrating nights were worth every hour spent. The whole pipeline of developing a Steam game that hundreds of users could play without running into troubles was stressful at times but was very rewarding in the end when users actually downloaded the application. I can confirm that I have broadened my knowledge of game production and publication since I was able to release a fully playable and purchasable VR game. It was very rewarding to follow all aspects of game development and not just focused on the main programming objective.

## Learning Process

By the end of the senior design project deadline I was able to release a fully playable and purchasable SteamVR game. I reached my main goal of releasing a Steam game but it was a rough road to get there. I had to spend twenty to thirty hours a week to make large amounts of progress throughout the semester. As a rough outline on the process I took on creating the Excavator Simulator VR game is as follows:

1. Configured SteamVR and got headset tracking in 3D space
2. Bought and implemented mesh terrain system for realtime digging
3. Bought and modified excavator model
4. Setup VR space within excavator model
5. Implemented joystick and lever interactions
6. Added excavator movement
7. Bought and implemented voxel terrain systems for more performant digging system
8. Heavily optimized geometry and shaders
9. Added laser pointer menu system
10. Created three tutorial levels
11. Tested and bug fixes
12. User feedback
13. Created Steam page and promotional material
14. Tested and bug fixes
15. User feedback
16. Release

The accomplishments from this project were:
* I created a fully playable and purchasable Steam game.
* The VR game was fully optimized so that it can run on minimum hardware specs.
* I created three tutorial levels that showcase basic functionality of an excavator.
* An interactive digging of dirt mechanic that generates and absorbs particles.
* I created virtual joysticks and levers that feel “real” or natural to use within VR.

The challenges or obstacles were:
* The planned deadline was moved so the scope of the game was reduced significantly. Going from many missions and tutorial levels down to just three.
* The allocated project time was reduced by 60% due to other school work so the scope of work was reduced.
* I invested time into learning a newer articulation body system but ended up just using a tank simulation plugin.
* I ran into performance issues throughout development so geometry, shaders, and the terrain system was optimized.
* Publishing to Steam took longer than expected due to the amount of art assets and processes that needed to be learned.

## What Was Accomplished?

The final product that was developed and produced was a publicly accessible and purchasable SteamVR game. The game is relatively bug free and works with any main steam VR headset with controllers. This included Oculus Rift, Oculus Rift S, HTC Vive, and the Valve Index. Excavator Simulator VR has 112 downloads within the first two days of launch, showing that people are actually interested in the concept of VR excavation. The content of the same included three tutorial missions all in which are free roam and explorable. These tutorial levels are mostly for education purposes only since they are quite short in actual playtime.

## Effort Put In?

As a solo developer on this project, I had to put in many more hours than I would assume most individuals would put forth for a school project. Using a time management tracking software called ManicTime and adjusting the tracked time for other planning time not recorded by the software; it is estimated that I spent about 250 hours on the project during the spring 2021 semester. This accounts for tasks such as 3d modeling, project planning, level design, programming, Steam publishing, and promotion material designing.
